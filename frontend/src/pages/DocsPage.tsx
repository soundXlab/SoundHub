        <p className="docs-lead">
          `snd` is a small CLI that turns a DAW project into a versioned commit —
          and with a master render, into a public review session with gapless A/B.
          The same pipeline powers the Max for Live push button through the
          localhost bridge (`snd serve`).

        <p className="docs-note">
          Push is atomic (no half-pushed versions), preflighted (corrupt files are
          rejected), and idempotent — re-pushing the same export creates no new
          blobs. See the README for the full bridge contract, error codes and smoke
          commands.
